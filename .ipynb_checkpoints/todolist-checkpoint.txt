todo: 

# fix 1000
# concatenate result vectors
# return G, recursion

# sort 2x
# redis function caching?

0.01 to 0.1 s per merging
memory leaks? but no segmentation faults, it runs well with any input.

Slide: modular input -> output. pre/post processing. 
critical thing: correct input, not the postprocessing or merging operation. recursion comparatively simple. 
inputs which give us the best shot at recovering the original best path. 
timing recursively, has to include inheritence. 

Slide indirect paths: function call with move set

example: rb2 / barriers

neighbor function (inbuilt)

indications / observations:
employ Similar principle: "correct" indirect moves are "dominant"
